# bacterialbomb

Assignment 2 for University of Leeds coding course 5003M

## Project description

This is a coding project with the objective of mapping where particles may land from a fictitious bacterial bomb released in an urban environment.

The bomb is exploded on top of a 75m building and then particles move in three dimensions before eventually landing on the ground. 

The project has the following steps
1. Scraping the data file with the bomb location from the web
2. Identifying the bomb site
3. Modelling the particle movements for 5000 particles
4. Recording where the particles land
5. Producing a density map to show where the particles land
6. Saving the particle landing data to a text file

## Using the code

The model can be run at the command line. You will need to be connected to the web (for scraping the data). There is a GUI with instructions.

There are three options in the GUI. You can choose the number of particles. You can select the windspeed and you can select the surface that the particles land on (either a flat plain or a contoured surface).

## Jupyter Notebook

There is an associated Jupyter Notebook which explains how the code was developed, explains some of the challenges and describes each block of code.
