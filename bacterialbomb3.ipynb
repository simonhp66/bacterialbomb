    "# Bacterial bomb\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an assessed project as part of Geog5003M at the University of Leeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project involves tracking the fallout from an imaginary biological bomb that has been set off in an urban area. The aim is to read in a file which identifies where the bomb has been set off and then to track the spread of the particles and map where they land. This is a probability based approach where the direction and altitude of each particle depends on windspeed and height. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic code maps the particles onto a flat plain surface. The project is then extended by enabling the user to choose the number of particles, the windspeed and to have the particles landing on a contoured surface or digital elevation model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in python and runs within this Jupyter notebook. It can also be run at the command line. It has a GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 How this notebook is organised\n",
    "\n",
    "After the introduction in section 1, section 2 takes the reader through the development of the basic model and functionality. Section 3 then adds some more complex overlays to the basic model including having the bomb particles fall onto a more complex terrain and then the potential impact of a rainstorm washing the particles along the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the appendix is the completed final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Bacterial bombs and mapping fallout in context\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a heightened concern around the use of \"dirty bombs\". There are a plethora of both state sponsored and independent \"bad actors\" who are motivated to cause terror. There have been several incidents of apparently deliberate poisoning with radioactive materials although these have been targeted at specific indivudalsrather than causing terror to a community. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the covid crisis people are at a heightened sense of alert and concern over health issues in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelling and mapping dirty bombs (read some academic material, particularly the use of computer modelling) \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 How the code was developed\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic algorithmn given in the instructions was followed and the basic structure of the code is similar to an earlier piece of work on agent based modelling. Initially the logic for particle movement was developed for a single particle and once it was working it was developed for a class of particles. \n",
    "The basic model was then further developed by including a GUI with some user choices. Some complexity was added by considering how the particles would land on a surface that was not flat. This means that on each iteration one needs to consider the height of the particle and the height of the land at that point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Areas for further development\n",
    "\n",
    "The next stage would be to consider how the particles might flow from their landing point in event being of washed away in a rainstorm. In order to do this one would need to consider the height of each cell and its 8 neighbours to establish in which direction the particles would flow. This is quite complex because many cells are the same height as their neighbours. \n"

    "\n",
    "A graphical user interface (\"GUI\") has been developed allowing the user to choose options. There are three choices to be made - the number of particles, the windspeed and the surface that the particles land on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended number of particles is 5000 although, as you will see in the output, it is common to have individual particles landing some distance from the main landing area. If the user is concerned about this then the model could be run multiple times or the number of particles increased to have a clear understanding of the potential landing range under different circumstances.The landing zone is also highly susceptible to changes in assumptions about particle movement. If there is some uncertainty about these parameters then a more cautious approach would be to consider a wider area to be the \"danger zone\" and not just the areas where particles are modelled to land.\n",
    "\n",
    "The windspeed can be varied. This influences both the turbulence when the particles are high and the distance particles can travel in the direction of the prevailing wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic model considers the particles landing on a flat surface. In real life surfaces are not usually flat so there is also the option to choose a contoured surface and see how this influences the landing zone.\n",
