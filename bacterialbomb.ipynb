    "# Bacterial bomb\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an assessed project as part of Geog5003M at the University of Leeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project involves tracking the fallout from an imaginary biological bomb that has been set off in an urban area. The aim is to read in a file which identifies where the bomb has been set off and then to track the spread of the particles and map where they land. This is a probability based approach where the direction and altitude of each particle depends on windspeed and height. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic code maps the particles onto a flat plain surface. The project is then extended by enabling the user to choose the number of particles, the windspeed and to have the particles landing on a contoured surface or digital elevation model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in python and runs within this Jupyter notebook. It can also be run at the command line. It has a GUI. When the code is run in this notebook it opens a GUI window and the user has to complete the various options and close this window for the model to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 How this notebook is organised\n",
    "\n",
    "Index\n",
    " 1 Introduction\n",
    " 2 Walking through the model step by step\n",
    " 3 Moving particles (in associated file particlemove.py)\n",
    " 4 Testing and Timing\n",
    " 5 Examining output\n",
    " 6 Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The completed final model is also saved in the GitHub repositary along with the associated files needed to run it. The file is best run at the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 How the code was developed\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic algorithmn given in the instructions was followed and the basic structure of the code is similar to an earlier piece of work on agent based modelling. The basic strucure has a main file (bacterialbomb.py) and an associated file for a class of particles (particlemove.py). Initially the logic for particle movement was developed for a single particle and once it was working it was developed as a method for the class of particles. Then the particles were recorded where they land and this data was mapped into a density map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic model was then further developed by including a GUI with some user choices. Some complexity was added by considering how the particles would land on a surface that was not flat. This means that on each iteration one needs to consider the height of the particle and the height of the land at that point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Challenges encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge was how to present the data in a density map using matplotlib whilst also showing the terrain in the digital elevation model.The solution was a hybrid plot using a filled contour plot for the elevation and marking particles with dots that were coloured based on the number of particles at that location. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were also a number of minor technical challenges around developing the GUI, having the code structure work in a Jupter Notebook, accessing the data using Beautiful Soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Areas for further development\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possible areas for further development.\n",
    "1. Allowing the user to choose the wind direction. \n",
    "This model has the predominant wind from the East. The model could allow the user to choose the wind direction. However the modeled surface would need to be extended in size otherwise particles would move off the edge of the area.\n",
    "2. Modelling the effects of a rainstorm\n",
    "Another development would be to consider how the particles might flow from their landing point in event being of washed away in a rainstorm. In order to do this one would need to consider the height of each cell and its 8 neighbours to establish in which direction the water (and therefore particles) would flow. This is quite complex because many cells are the same height as their neighbours."

    "### 2.3 Creating a GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "A graphical user interface (\"GUI\") has been developed allowing the user to choose options. There are three choices to be made - the number of particles, the windspeed and the surface that the particles land on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended number of particles is 5000 although, as you will see in the output, it is common to have individual particles landing some distance from the main landing area. If the user is concerned about this then the model could be run multiple times or the number of particles increased to have a clear understanding of the potential landing range under different circumstances.The landing zone is also highly susceptible to changes in assumptions about particle movement. If there is some uncertainty about these parameters then a more cautious approach would be to consider a wider area to be the \"danger zone\" and not just the areas where particles are modelled to land.\n",
    "\n",
    "The windspeed can be varied. This influences both the turbulence when the particles are high and the distance particles can travel in the direction of the prevailing wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic model considers the particles landing on a flat surface. In real life surfaces are not usually flat so there is also the option to choose a contoured surface and see how this influences the landing zone.\n",

The model is only as useful as the assumptions made so the simplistic assumptions about probabilities of particles moving in a particular way would need to be further developed and tested to make this a useful model.
